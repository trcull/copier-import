		<p>Without intervention, some of your customers will forget about you and never come back.  We help you 
			turn that around by calculating when that "lost-cause" point is and prodding your customer with an email and a discount.
			Since your relationship with that customer is essentially over anyway it's practically free money, with almost no risk.</p>

	<h4>Do you know how many of your customers ever come back a second time?</h4>
	<p>If you don't, you're not alone.  Most eCommerce retailers don't know that simple statistic, one that is the biggest lever you have
		for stretching your customer acquisition dollars even further.  Retention Factory gives you that statistic, and more, 
		by plugging into your favorite eCommerce platform and analyzing your customer buying patterns.  And it doesn't stop there...</p>
	<p>Retention Factory also uses the
		knowledge it gains to automatically send your past customers <em>just the right email at just the right time</em> to bring them
		back for more.  You've put 
		a lot of time, effort, and cost into getting customers to your store in the first place.  Now how about capitalizing on that 
		investment by continuing the relationship beyond the first sale.  It takes <em>three times as much</em> to bring in a new customer
		as it does to sell to an existing one. 
	</p>
	<p>So, while you concentrate on bringing even more new customers to your store, let us concentrate on bringing your old customers back 
		for more.</p>
